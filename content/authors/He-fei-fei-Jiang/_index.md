During my undergraduate studies, I have been working on scientific exploration in the areas of deep learning, machine learning, image segmentation, and medical imaging, and have published two journal articles in the Science Citation Index. One of them I published in SCI Q2 (IF:2.940) as the first student author and corresponding author. In addition as the second student author published a paper in SCI Q2 (IF:2.838).

I am a third-year bachelor Student in Computer Science & Technology at Shaanxi Technology and Science University(SUST). I participated in the SUSTâ€™s cooperation academic project with Ulster University, and expected double Bachelor of Science in July.2024
